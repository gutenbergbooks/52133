<h2><a id="EDITORS_PREFACE"></a>EDITOR’S PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0">This book is intended to be a representative
collection of the patriotic poetry of the British
Empire. I have taken a wide view of the
term “patriotic”&mdash;wide enough, indeed, to include
the Jacobite Songs of Scotland and the
National Songs of Ireland.</p>

<p>Many of my numbers breathe the spirit of
war; for the national instinct is most deeply
stirred in times of great national emotion.
But I have aimed at making this volume
something more than a book of war-songs,
holding that a man may prove his patriotism
as well at home in the pursuit of his daily
business as on the battlefield in the presence
of his country’s enemies. Love of country is
the root of the matter; and, after all, it is
harder to live for one’s country than to die
for it.</p>

<p>I gratefully acknowledge the debt I owe
to authors and owners of copyright poems.
I am equally grateful to all who, whether
at home or in the Colonies, have given me
encouragement, assistance, or advice. My<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x">x</a></span>
obligations to Professor Dowden, Mr. W.&nbsp;E.
Henley, and Mr. A.&nbsp;T. Quiller-Couch are very
great.</p>

<p>My scheme, as originally conceived, provided
for the inclusion of a section representing the
patriotism of America; but, on reconsideration,
I have decided not to go beyond the limits of
the British Empire.</p>

<h2><a id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p>The present collection of patriotic songs will,
I think, accord with the imperial spirit of the
day; for they are representative of the whole
British Empire.</p>

<p>It is needless to dwell upon the inspiring
energy of song. Since the age of Tyrtæus it
has everywhere been recognised as a powerful
incentive to valour. A nation can scarcely exist
without a national anthem. How characteristic
are the anthems of the nations! It may almost
be said that the difference of the English and
the French nations is expressed by the contrast
between <cite>God Save the King</cite> and the <cite>Marseillaise</cite>.
What an influence songs have exercised upon
the life of nations! The debt of Scotland to
Burns, the debt of Ireland to Moore, is greater
than words can tell. Fletcher of Saltoun was
perhaps not wrong in his estimate of the songs,
as compared with the laws, of a nation.</p>

<p>I am not responsible for the present collection;
perhaps, if I had made it, I should
have left out some few songs which find a
place in it, and should have inserted some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii">xii</a></span>
few others which do not, but the purpose of
it I heartily approve. To consolidate the
Empire, and to animate it as a whole with
noble ideas, is one of the greatest needs and
duties of the present day; and an empire,
like an individual, lives not by bread alone, but
by its sentiments, its ambitions, its ideals.</p>

<span class="i0">In the Ocean’s bosom unespied,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The listening winds received this song.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">‘What should we do but sing His praise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That led us through the watery maze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where He the huge sea-monsters wracks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That lift the deep upon their backs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unto an isle so long unknown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet far kinder than our own?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He lands us on a grassy stage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Safe from the storms and prelates’ rage:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He gave us this eternal spring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which here enamels everything,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sends the fowls to us in care<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On daily visits through the air.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He hangs in shades the orange bright<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like golden lamps in a green night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And does in the pomegranates close<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jewels more rich than Ormus shows:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He makes the figs our mouths to meet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And throws the melons at our feet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But apples plants of such a price,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No tree could ever bear them twice.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With cedars chosen by His hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Lebanon He stores the land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And makes the hollow seas that roar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proclaim the ambergrease on shore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He cast (of which we rather boast)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Gospel’s pearl upon our coast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in these rocks for us did frame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A temple where to sound His name.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O let our voice His praise exalt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till it arrive at Heaven’s vault,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which thence (perhaps) rebounding may<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Echo beyond the Mexique Bay!’<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus sang they in the English boat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A holy and a cheerful note:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the way, to guide their chime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With falling oars they kept the time.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Upon the plan that pleased his boyish thought:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose high endeavours are an inward light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That makes the path before him always bright:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">On honourable terms, or else retire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in himself possess his own desire;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And therefore does not stoop, nor lie in wait<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Or he must fall, to sleep without his fame,<br /></span>

<span class="i4">O, what a snug little island!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">They’d all have a touch at the island!<br /></span>

<span class="i2">‘Is a lad who will answer your purpose completely.’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My father was a corporal, and well he knew his trade,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">For a nimble-wristed round rattan the sergeant flourished proudly.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My father died when corporal, but I ne’er turned my back,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Till, promoted to the halberd, I was sergeant in a crack.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">In sword and sash cut a dash,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To quick time we footed, and sung all the way<br /></span>
<span class="i2">‘Hey for the pretty girls we love so dearly!’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My father lived with jolly boys in bustle, jars, and strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, like him, being fond of noise, I mean to take a wife<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of glory to be won without long toil<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Save when Death takes the aspirant by the hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cutting short the work of years, at once<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Such fate was mine.&mdash;The standard of the Buffs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I bore at Albuera, on that day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, covered by a shower, and fatally<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For friends misdeem’d, the Polish lancers fell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon our rear. Surrounding me, they claim’d<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My precious charge.&mdash;‘Not but with life!’ I cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And life was given for immortality.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flag which to my heart I held, when wet<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Regain’d on that great day. In former times,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Marlborough beheld it borne at Ramilies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Brunswick and for liberty it waved<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The lilies on the Caribbean shores<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Abased before it. Then too in the front<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of battle did it flap exultingly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Douro, with its wide stream interposed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saved not the French invaders from attack,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Discomfiture, and ignominious rout.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My name is Thomas: undisgraced have I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Transmitted it. He who in days to come<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Attend, all ye who list to hear our noble England’s praise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I tell of the thrice famous deeds she wrought in ancient days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When that great fleet invincible against her bore in vain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The richest spoils of Mexico, the stoutest hearts of Spain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was about the lovely close of a warm summer day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There came a gallant merchant-ship full sail to Plymouth Bay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her crew hath seen Castile’s black fleet, beyond Aurigny’s isle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At earliest twilight, on the waves lie heaving many a mile.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At sunrise she escaped their van, by God’s especial grace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the tall <i>Pinta</i>, till the noon, had held her close in chase.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forthwith a guard at every gun was placed along the wall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The beacon blazed upon the roof of Edgecumbe’s lofty hall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many a light fishing-bark put out to pry along the coast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with loose rein and bloody spur rode inland many a post.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his white hair unbonneted, the stout old sheriff comes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behind him march the halberdiers; before him sound the drums;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His yeomen round the market cross make clear an ample space;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For there behoves him to set up the standard of Her Grace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And haughtily the trumpets peal, and gaily dance the bells,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As slow upon the labouring wind the royal blazon swells.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look how the Lion of the sea lifts up his ancient crown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And underneath his deadly paw treads the gay lilies down!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So stalked he when he turned to flight, on that famed Picard field,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bohemia’s plume, and Genoa’s bow, and Cæsar’s eagle shield.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So glared he when at Agincourt in wrath he turned to bay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And crushed and torn beneath his claws the princely hunters lay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ho! strike the flagstaff deep, Sir Knight: ho! scatter flowers, fair maids:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ho! gunners, fire a loud salute: ho! gallants, draw your blades:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou sun, shine on her joyously: ye breezes, waft her wide;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our glorious <span class="smcap">Semper Eadem</span>, the banner of our pride.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">The freshening breeze of eve unfurled that banner’s massy fold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The parting gleam of sunshine kissed that haughty scroll of gold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Night sank upon the dusky beach and on the purple sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such night in England ne’er had been, nor e’er again shall be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Eddystone to Berwick bounds, from Lynn to Milford Bay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That time of slumber was as bright and busy as the day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For swift to east and swift to west the ghastly war-flame spread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High on St. Michael’s Mount it shone: it shone on Beachy Head.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far on the deep the Spaniard saw, along each southern shire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cape beyond cape, in endless range, those twinkling points of fire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fisher left his skiff to rock on Tamar’s glittering waves:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rugged miners poured to war from Mendip’s sunless caves!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O’er Longleat’s towers, o’er Cranbourne’s oaks, the fiery herald flew:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He roused the shepherds of Stonehenge, the rangers of Beaulieu.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Right sharp and quick the bells all night rang out from Bristol town,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ere the day three hundred horse had met on Clifton down;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sentinel on Whitehall gate looked forth into the night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And saw o’erhanging Richmond Hill the streak of blood-red light:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then bugle’s note and cannon’s roar the death-like silence broke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with one start, and with one cry, the royal city woke.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At once on all her stately gates arose the answering fires;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At once the wild alarum clashed from all her reeling spires;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From all the batteries of the Tower pealed loud the voice of fear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the thousand masts of Thames sent back a louder cheer;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from the furthest wards was heard the rush of hurrying feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the broad streams of pikes and flags rushed down each roaring street;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And broader still became the blaze, and louder still the din,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As fast from every village round the horse came spurring in.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And eastward straight from wild Blackheath the warlike errand went,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And roused in many an ancient hall the gallant squires of Kent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Southward from Surrey’s pleasant hills flew those bright couriers forth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High on bleak Hampstead’s swarthy moor they started for the north;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on, and on, without a pause, untired they bounded still:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All night from tower to tower they sprang; they sprang from hill to hill:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the proud Peak unfurled the flag o’er Darwin’s rocky dales,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till like volcanoes flared to heaven the stormy hills of Wales,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till twelve fair Counties saw the blaze on Malvern’s lonely height,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till streamed in crimson on the wind the Wrekin’s crest of light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till broad and fierce the star came forth on Ely’s stately fane,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tower and hamlet rose in arms o’er all the boundless plain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till Belvoir’s lordly terraces the sign to Lincoln sent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Lincoln sped the message on o’er the wide vale of Trent;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till Skiddaw saw the fire that burned on Gaunt’s embattled pile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the red glare on Skiddaw roused the burghers of Carlisle.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A greater than Philip their lord, a new Armada in might:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the sails were aloft once more in the deep Gaditanian bay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where <i>Redoubtable</i> and <i>Bucentaure</i> and great <i>Trinidada</i> lay;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Eager-reluctant to close; for across the bloodshed to be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two navies beheld one prize in its glory,&mdash;the throne of the sea!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which were bravest, who should tell? for both were gallant and true;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the greatest seaman was ours, of all that sail’d o’er the blue.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">From Cadiz the enemy sallied: they knew not Nelson was there;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His name a navy to us, but to them a flag of despair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Twixt Algeziras and Aquamonte he guarded the coast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till he bore from Tavira south; and they now must fight or be lost;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vainly they steered for the Rock and the mid-land sheltering sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he headed the Admirals round, constraining them under his lee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Villeneuve of France, and Gravina of Spain; so they shifted their ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They could choose,&mdash;they were more than we;&mdash;and they faced at Trafalgar round;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rampart-like ranged in line, a sea-fortress angrily towered!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the midst, four-storied with guns, the dark <i>Trinidada</i> lower’d.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">So with those&mdash;But, meanwhile, as against some dyke that men massively rear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From on high the torrent surges, to drive through the dyke as a spear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eagle-eyed e’en in his blindness, our chief sets his double array,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Making the fleet two spears, to thrust at the foe any way, ...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘Anyhow!&mdash;without orders, each captain his Frenchman may grapple perforce;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Collingwood first’ (yet the <i>Victory</i> ne’er a whit slacken’d her course)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘Signal for action! Farewell! we shall win, but we meet not again!’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Then a low thunder of readiness ran from the decks o’er the main,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on,&mdash;as the message from masthead to masthead flew out like a flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">England expects every man will do his duty</span>,&mdash;they came.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Clothe them in billowy snow, tier speaking o’er tier as they lay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flashes that thrust and drew in, as swords when the battle is rife;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ours stood frowningly smiling, and ready for death as for life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;O in that interval grim, ere the furies of slaughter embrace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thrills o’er each man some far echo of England; some glance of some face!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Faces gazing seaward through tears from the ocean-girt shore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Faces that ne’er can be gazed on again till the death pang is o’er....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lone in his cabin the Admiral kneeling, and all his great heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a child’s to the mother, goes forth to the loved one, who bade him depart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">... O not for death, but glory! her smile would welcome him home!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Louder and thicker the thunderbolts fall:&mdash;and silent they come.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As when beyond Dongola the lion, whom hunters attack,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">So between Spaniard and Frenchman the <i>Victory</i> wedged with a shout,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gun against gun; a cloud from her decks and lightning went out;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Iron hailing of pitiless death from the sulphury smoke;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Voices hoarse and parch’d, and blood from invisible stroke.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each man stood to his work, though his mates fell smitten around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As an oak of the wood, while his fellow, flame-shatter’d, besplinters the ground:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gluttons of danger for England, but sparing the foe as he lay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the spirit of Nelson was on them, and each was Nelson that day.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘She has struck!’&mdash;he shouted&mdash;‘She burns, the <i>Redoubtable</i>! Save whom we can;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘Silence our guns:’&mdash;for in him the woman was great in the man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In that heroic heart each drop girl-gentle and pure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dying by those he spared;&mdash;and now Death’s triumph was sure!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the deck the smoke-wreath clear’d, and the foe set his rifle in rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dastardly aiming, where Nelson stood forth, with the stars on his breast,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘In honour I gained them, in honour I die with them!’ ... Then, in his place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fell ... ‘Hardy! ’tis over; but let them not know:’ and he cover’d his face.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Silent the whole fleet’s darling they bore to the twilight below:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And above the war-thunder came shouting, as foe struck his flag after foe.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To his heart death rose: and for Hardy, the faithful, he cried in his pain,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘How goes the day with us, Hardy?’...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘’Tis ours’:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he knew, not in vain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not in vain for his comrades and England he bled: how he left her secure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Queen of her own blue seas, while his name and example endure.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O, like a lover he loved her! for her as water he pours<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Life-blood and life and love, lavish’d all for her sake, and for ours!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;‘Kiss me, Hardy!&mdash;Thank God!&mdash;I have done my duty!’&mdash;and then<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For Captain Davy Dann was a famous fightin’ man,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who lov’d the smell o’ powder and the thunder o’ the guns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And off the coast of France often made the Frenchmen dance<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To the music from his sloop of only ninety tons.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So at the break o’ day there were hundreds on the quay<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To see the gallant ship a-warping out to sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Mayor, Daniel Chubb, was hoisted on a tub,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And he cried, ‘Good luck to Dann, with a three times three!’<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For the news that came from Fowey was that ev’ry man and boy<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And all the gallants there were expecting of a ship.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the lively lads o’ Looe, they thought they’d watch her too,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lest the Frenchman showed his heels and gave ’em all the slip.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So along by Talland Bay the good ship sailed away,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the boats were out at Polperro to see what they could see;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And old Dann, he cried, ‘Ahoy! you’d better come to Fowey,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And help to blow the Mounseers to the bottom of the sea!’<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now, ’twas almost set o’ sun, and the day was almost done,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When we sighted of a frigate beating up against the wind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we put on all our sail till we came within her hail,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And old Dann politely asked, ‘Will you follow us behind?’<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But the Frenchmen fore and aft only stood and grinned and laughed,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And never guessed the captain was in earnest, don’t you see?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For we’d only half her guns, and were only ninety tons,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And they thought they’d blow us easy to the bottom o’ the sea.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But our brave old Captain Dann&mdash;oh, he was a proper man!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sang out with voice like thunder unto ev’ry man aboard:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘Now all you men of Looe just show what you can do,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And we’ll board her, and we’ll take her, by the help o’ the Lord!’<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then up her sides we swarm’d, and along her deck we storm’d,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And sword and pike were busy for the space of half an hour;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But before the day was done, tho’ they number’d two to one,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Her commander had to yield, and his flag to lower.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then we turn’d our ship about, and while the stars came out<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We tow’d our prize right cheerily past Fowey and Polperro;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we blest old Captain Dann, for we hadn’t lost a man,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And our wounded all were doing well a-down below.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And when we came to Looe, all the town was there to view,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the mayor in his chain and gown he cried out lustily,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘Nine cheers for Captain Dann, and three for every man,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the good ship <i>George</i> that carried them to victory!’<br /></span>

<span class="i2">And they see strange bows above them and the two go locked to death.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">But whether in calm or wrack-wreath, whether by dark or day<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I heave them whole to the conger or rip their plates away,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">First of the scattered legions, under a shrieking sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Dipping between the rollers, the English Flag goes by.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">The dead dumb fog hath wrapped it&mdash;the frozen dews have kissed&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Since from that ancient pain,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Feels through her veins new patriot currents move,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from thy ashes, like the Phœnix springs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Skyward on soaring wings,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">On your green uplands is a picture rare;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You crowd around me like young maidens peepin’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And puzzlin’ me to say which is most fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As tho’ you longed to see your own sweet faces<br /></span>

<span class="i0">My fondest blessin’ on those lovely places,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">How often when alone at work I’m sittin’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And musin’ sadly on the days of yore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I think I see my pretty Katie knittin’,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The childer playin’ round the cabin door;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I think I see the neighbours’ kindly faces<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All gathered round, their long-lost friend to see;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tho’ none here knows how very fair that place is,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">No fires are lighted there&mdash;no battle songs they sing.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When the cry for help goes seaward, she will find her servants there.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Battered chain-gangs of the orlop, grizzled drafts of years gone by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the bench that broke their manhood, they shall lash themselves and die.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hale and crippled, young and aged, paid, deserted, shipped away&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Palace, cot, and lazaretto shall make up the tale that day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the skies are black above them, and the decks ablaze beneath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the topmen clear the raffle with their clasp-knives in their teeth.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It may be that Fate will give me life and leave to row once more&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Set some strong man free for fighting as I take awhile his oar.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But to-day I leave the galley. Shall I curse her service then?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God be thanked&mdash;whate’er comes after, I have lived and toiled with Men!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And the resolute eye that loves the lead,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the quarters massive and square&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">That the hound could outpace the horse;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I remember how few in the front rank show’d,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">How endless appeared the tail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the brown hillside, where we cross’d the road<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The dark brown steed on the left was there,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And between the pair on a chestnut mare<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The duffer who writes this lay.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">As we splash’d through the marshy ground;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I remember the laugh that all the while<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On his quiet features played:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So he rode to his death, with that careless smile,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In the van of the Light Brigade;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So stricken by Russian grape, the cheer<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Rang out while he toppled back,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the shattered lungs as merry and clear<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As it did when it roused the pack.<br /></span>

<span class="i2"><span class="smcap">A type of our chivalry</span>!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I remember one thrust he gave to his hat,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And two to the flanks of the brown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still as a statue of old he sat,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And he shot to the front, hands down;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I remember the snort and the stag-like bound<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of the steed six lengths to the fore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the laugh of the rider while, landing sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He turned in his saddle and glanced around;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I remember&mdash;but little more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save a bird’s-eye gleam of the dashing stream,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A jarring thud on the wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A shock, and the blank of a nightmare’s dream,&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Not e’en a passing playful breeze<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Our heritage is hope. We’ll rear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Nation worthy of the land;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when in age we linger late,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the heights above life’s vale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before we, like the mist, shall merge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In depths of God’s eternity,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We’ll see, perchance, our influence<br /></span>

<h4><a href="#poemr_I">I</a></h4>

<p><i>Agincourt, or the English Bowmans Glory. To a pleasant new
Tune.</i> Quoted in Heywood’s <cite>King Edward IV.</cite>, and, therefore,
popular before 1600. This ballad has been severely edited, and I
omit several stanzas. It is printed in full in Hazlitt’s edition of
Collier’s ‘Shakespeare’s Library,’ vol. i. (Reeves &amp; Turner, 1825).</p>

<h4><a href="#poemr_II">II</a></h4>

<p>Published in 1589.</p>

<h4><a href="#poemr_III">III</a>&ndash;<a href="#poemr_IV">IV</a></h4>

<p>Both were published in <cite>Poemes Lyrick and Pastorall</cite> (1605?) and
<cite>Poemes</cite> (1619). As to the first:&mdash;l. 6. <i>Caux</i> (‘commonlie called
Kidcaux,’ says Holinshed) was the district north-east of the mouth
of the Seine.</p>

<p>
l. 83. <i>bilbos.</i> Swords, from Bilbao.<br />
<br />
<span class="notein2">92. <i>ding.</i> To belabour with blows.</span>
</p>

<h4><a href="#poemr_V">V</a>&ndash;<a href="#poemr_VI">VI</a></h4>

<p>The first is from John of Gaunt’s dying speech (<cite>King Richard II.</cite>,
Act ii. sc. 1). <cite>King Richard II.</cite> was probably written early in
1593. It was published anonymously in 1597. The second is from
<cite>King John</cite>, Act v. sc. 7. 1594 is the date assigned to Shakespeare’s
<cite>King John</cite>, which was first printed in the First Folio (1623).
These and the two succeeding numbers follow the text of ‘The
Globe Edition’ of Shakespeare’s Works. I am indebted to the
publishers of that edition, Messrs. Macmillan &amp; Co., and to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324">324</a></span>
Delegates of the Clarendon Press, Oxford, for kindly extending
to readers of this volume the benefits of the scientific labours of
Dr. W.&nbsp;G. Clark and Mr. W.&nbsp;A. Wright.</p>

<h4><a href="#poemr_VII">VII</a></h4>

<p>From various parts of <cite>King Henry V.</cite> The play was written in
1598, and performed for the first time early in 1599. The first
complete version was published in the First Folio (1623).</p>

<p>There are broadsides of this ballad in the Roxburghe and Bagford
Collections. The version here given is taken from Mr. Henley’s
volume, <cite>Lyra Heroica</cite> (David Nutt, 1891), by permission of
editor and publisher. The full title of the Roxburghe broadside
is as follows:&mdash;‘The Honour of Bristol, shewing how the Angel
Gabriel of Bristol fought with three ships, who boarded as many
times, wherein we cleared our Decks, and killed five hundred of
their Men, and wounded many more, and make them fly into Cales,
where we lost but three men, to the Honour of the Angel Gabriel
of Bristol. To the tune of <i>Our Noble King in his Progress</i>.’</p>

<p>The first is entitled: <cite>To the Lord General Cromwell, May 1652:
On the Proposals of certain Ministers at the Committee for Propagation
of the Gospel</cite>, and was written against the intolerant
Fifteen Proposals of John Owen and the majority of the Committee.
This sonnet first appeared at the end of Philip’s <cite>Life of

<p><i>Hireling wolves</i> (l. 14)=the paid clergy.</p>

<p>The second is from the chorus of <i>Samson Agonistes</i> (ll. 1268&ndash;1286).
<cite>Samson Agonistes</cite> was first published in 1671, in the small

<p>The second appeared in <cite>Poems</cite> (1681).</p>

<h4><a href="#poemr_XV">XV</a></h4>

<p>Produced in 1643. The author was a famous ballad-monger of
Charles I.’s time. The original refrain was ‘When the King comes
home in peace again’ (<cite>Roxburghe Collection of Ballads</cite>, iii. 256;
<cite>Loyal Garland</cite>, 1671 and 1686; Ritson, <cite>Ancient Songs</cite>). The
song was written to support the declining cause of the Royal
Martyr. It helped to keep up the spirits of the Cavaliers in the
days before the Restoration (1660), which event it was used to
celebrate. When the Revolution (1688) drove the Stuarts into
exile, this song became a weapon in the hands of the Jacobites.</p>

<h4><a href="#poemr_XVI">XVI</a></h4>

<p>This was a very popular loyal song in the reign of Charles II.
Both words and music are given in Playford’s <cite>Musical Companion</cite>
(1667).</p>

<h4><a href="#poemr_XVII">XVII</a>&mdash;<a href="#poemr_XVIII">XVIII</a></h4>

<p>The first is from Dryden’s opera, <cite>King Arthur, or the British
Worthy</cite> (1691). As to the first: ‘A battle is supposed to be given<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326">326</a></span>
behind the scenes, with drums, trumpets, and military shouts and
excursions; after which, the Britons, expressing their joy for the
victory, sing this song of triumph.’&mdash;Author’s Note.</p>

<p>The second is an extract from <cite>Annus Mirabilis</cite> (1667).</p>

<h4><a href="#poemr_XIX">XIX</a></h4>

<p>This famous song, which Heine once declared expressed the
whole character of the English people, made its first appearance in
<cite>The Masque of Alfred</cite> (1740).</p>

<h4><a href="#poemr_XX">XX</a></h4>

<p>This song is at least as old as the reign of Queen Anne. In the
British Museum there are many half-sheet copies, with music. The
earliest begins, ‘Here’s a health to the Queen,’ &amp;c.</p>

<h4><a href="#poemr_XXI">XXI</a></h4>

<p>The first print of our National Anthem is to be found in <cite>Harmonica
Anglicana</cite>, a collation of part songs (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">circa</i> 1742). This
copy consists of two stanzas only. The third made its appearance
when <cite>Harmonica Anglicana</cite> was extended to two volumes, with the
new title <cite>Thesaurus Musicus</cite>. The copy printed in the <cite>Gentleman’s
Magazine</cite> (October 1745) contains the three stanzas given here, and
is called, ‘A Song for Two Voices sung at both play-houses.’</p>

<p>The first was written ‘after reading Hume’s <cite>History</cite> in 1780’
(Benham). The second was written in September 1782. The
<i>Royal George</i> (108 guns) was being repaired at Spithead (August
29, 1782), when she capsized and sank instantly. Rear-Admiral
Richard Kempenfelt was then under orders to proceed to the relief
of Gibraltar.</p>

<p>The first is from <cite>The Oddities, a Table Entertainment</cite> (1789&ndash;1790),
and its original title was <cite>Poor Tom, or the Sailor’s Epitaph</cite>.
The second was first sung in <cite>The Wags, or the Camp of Pleasure</cite>
(October 18, 1790). The third was first sung in <cite>A Tour to Land’s
End</cite> (1798), and its original title was <cite>Yo heave ho!</cite> The first
collected edition of Charles Dibdin’s songs was issued in five
volumes from 1790 to 1799.</p>

<p>The air of <cite>The British Grenadiers</cite> is at least as old as the reign
of Elizabeth, and is one of the most characteristic of the English
National airs. The words here given are from a copy (with music)
about a hundred and fifty years old.</p>

<h4><a href="#poemr_XXX">XXX</a></h4>

<p>Chappell dates this song 1758. The matter is not free from
doubt, but the reference in the second stanza to ‘Brighton Camp’
is a clue. There were encampments along the south coast (1758&ndash;9)
when Hawke and Rodney were watching the French fleet in Brest
Harbour. The song appears to be English, although it has appeared
in several collections of Irish music. I have omitted several stanzas
which appear in Chappell’s version (<cite>Popular Music of the Olden
Time</cite>, vol. ii. p. 710).</p>

The first (written at Altona during the winter of 1800&ndash;1) is based

to the second (written in 1805), I omit stanzas 5, 6, and 8, an improvement

Highly praised by Byron (1822)&mdash;‘Such an ode as only Campbell
could have written’&mdash;this poem was attributed to Byron himself,
and claimed by many impostors. The question of authorship was
settled in 1841 by the discovery of an autograph copy in a letter
from Wolfe to a college friend.</p>

<p>This ‘matchless wail’ (as Scott called it) was written in 1756.
For some time it was thought to be a genuine relic of the past.
Burns was one of the first to insist that it was a modern composition.
The ‘Forest’ is, of course, Ettrick Forest, that romantic
district comprising most of Selkirkshire and the neighbouring parts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340">340</a></span>
of Peebles and Edinburgh shires. A few straggling thorns and
solitary birches are the sole remaining traces of this ‘fein foreste,’
once the favourite hunting-ground of the Scottish kings.</p>

<p>l. 1. <i>Tara’s halls.</i> The hill of Tara, in Meath, was the meeting-place
for the election of the kings of Ireland; but most writers
on Irish antiquities are of opinion that there was no royal dwelling
there. It would seem, therefore, that ‘Tara’s halls’ never existed
but in the imagination of poets.</p>

<p>As to the fifth, Robert Emmet (1778&ndash;1803), United Irishman, the
leader of ‘Emmet’s Rising’ (1803), was arrested by Major Sirr<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345">345</a></span>
(the capturer of Lord Edward Fitzgerald), tried September 19, and
hanged next day (1803). He was engaged to be married to Sarah
Curran, daughter of the great lawyer, and it was to this lady Moore
addressed his famous poem. The lady subsequently (November 24,
1805) married Major Sturgeon of the Royal Staff Corps.</p>

<p>As to the third,&mdash;During the operations in Tirah (1897) the pass
of Saransar (or Saran Sur) was the retreat of the hillmen known as
the Lakka Khels. On November 9, a reconnaissance in force was
made up the pass. The firing from the heights was deadly and
continuous, and, in the evening, when our troops were retreating
down the pass, a small party of the 48th (Northamptonshire Regiment)
under Second Lieutenant Macintyre and Colour-Sergeant
Luck, were cut off and surrounded by the enemy. It was found
impossible to save them, and the following morning their dead
bodies were found together.</p>

Smith led the English forces out of Durban for a night attack on
Pretorius’ position at Congella. It was a moonlight night, and
the advance was observed. Our men were shot down as they
marched along the shore without cover. The survivors retreated
to Durban, and the Boers immediately invested the town. A
despatch-rider having made his way through the Boer lines, reinforcements
were sent by sea, and the siege was raised (June 25,
1842). Natal was annexed the following year, and the Boer was
thus headed off from the sea.</p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
